<h3>Spring Boot gives an easier, quicker path to set up, configure, and run apps. It eliminates the heavy lifting of configuration that is required for setting up most Spring-based apps. Developers can jump right in and use Spring Boot without ever having to learn the underlying Spring framework.</h3>

<h4>Spring Boot itself isn't designed for building full-fledged frontends. It is a powerful backend tool that can also provide frontend features. The more common architectural pattern is to have a separate frontend server for your frontends and rely on Spring Boot for backends</h4>
